New releases
============

When doing new releases of the plugin, check the following:

* Version number
	* Always change the version number when doing a new release of the plugin
		* WordPress does not require any specific versioning scheme, but it is recommended to use one,
		e.g. Semantic Versioning (http://semver.org/)
	* The version number is located in two files
		* In the main plugin file, woocommerce-nosto-tagging.php, the version number can be found in the comment at the top of
		the file and in the WC_Nosto_Tagging class constant VERSION
			* WordPress uses the version string in the top comment to show it on the plugin management screen and for the
			automatic plugin updates
			* The version string in the class constant is used to check version compatibility when the plugin is activated
		* In the plugin readme.txt file, the version number can be found in the Stable tag field
			* WordPress uses this when doing releases to the WordPress Plugins Directory
	* It is important that all the version numbers are kept identical
* Plugin updates
	* If the changes to the plugin require database changes, structural or content, then those should be invoked from
	the plugin activation hook, WC_Nosto_Tagging::activate()
	* This hook is run when activating the plugin manually, but also when using the automatic plugin update to update
	the plugin to a newer version
	* It is important to check if data exists before adding or modifying it, fortunately WordPress provides many useful
	utility functions to do this

When the plugin is ready to be released, create a new tag in the plugins subversion repository on wordpress.org.
Instructions on using the repository can be found at:
